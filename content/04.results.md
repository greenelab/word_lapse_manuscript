## Models can be aligned and compared within and between years

We examined how the usage of tokens in biomedical text changes over time using machine learning models.
We trained the models to predict the actual token given a portion of its surrounding tokens, and each token was represented as a vector in a coordinate space constructed by the models.

However, training these models is stochastic, resulting in arbitrary coordinate spaces.
Each model has its own unique coordinate space (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}A), and each word is represented within that space (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}B).
Model alignment is essential in allowing word2vec models to be compared [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.1605.09096; @doi:10.1038/s41597-021-01047-x].
Alignment projects every model onto a shared coordinate space (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}C), enabling direct token comparison.
To enable comparison of the models, we aligned them onto a shared coordinate space.
We randomly selected 100 tokens to confirm that alignment worked as expected.
We found that tokens in the global space were more similar to themselves within the year than between years, while identical tokens in unaligned models were completely distinct (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}D).
Local distances were unaffected by alignment, as token-neighbor distances remained unchanged (Figure {@fig:word2vec_alignment}D).

A. Without alignment, each word2vec model has its own coordinate space.
This is a UMAP visualization of 5000 randomly sampled tokens from 5 distinct Word2Vec models trained on the text published in 2010.
Each data point represents a token, and the color represents the respective Word2Vec model.
B. We greyed out all tokens except for the token 'probiotics' to highlight that each token appears in its own respective cluster without alignment.
C. After the alignment step, the token 'probiotics' is closer in vector space signifying that tokens can be easily compared.
D. In the global coordinate space, token distances appear to be vastly different when alignment is not applied.
After alignment, token distances become closer; tokens maintain similar distances with their neighbors regardless of alignment.
This boxplot shows the average distance of 100 randomly sampled tokens shared in every year from 2000 to 2021.
The x-axis shows the various groups being compared (tokens against themselves via intra-year and inter-year distances and tokens against their corresponding neighbors.
The y-axis shows the average distance for every year.

The landscape of biomedical publishing has changed rapidly during the period of our dataset.
The texts for our analysis were open-access manuscripts available through PubMed Central.
The growth in the amount of available text and the uneven adoption of open-access publishing during the interval studied was expected to induce changes in the underlying machine learning models, making comparisons more difficult.
We found that the number of tokens available for model building, i.e., those in PMC OA, increased dramatically during this time (Figure {@fig:novel_distance_validation}A).
This was expected to create a pattern where models trained in earlier years were more variable than those from later years simply due to the limited sample size in early years.
To correct for this change in the underlying models, we developed a statistic that compared tokens' intra- and inter-year variabilities.

A. The number of tokens our models have trained on increases over time.
This line plot shows the number of unique tokens our various machine-learning models see.
The x-axis depicts the year, and the y-axis shows the token count.
B. Earlier years compared to 2010 have greater distances than later years.
This confidence interval plot shows the collective distances obtained by sampling 100 tokens present from every year using a single model approach.
The x-axis shows a given year, and the y-axis shows the distance metric.
C. Later years have a lower intra-distance variability compared to the earlier years.
This confidence interval plot shows the collective distances obtained by sampling 100 tokens present from every year using our multi-model approach.
The x-axis shows a given year, and the y-axis shows the distance metric.

We expected most tokens to undergo minor changes from year to year, while substantial changes likely suggested model drift instead of true linguistic change.
We measured the extent to which tokens differed from themselves using the standard single-model approach and our integrated statistic.
We filtered the token list to only contain tokens present in every year and compared their distance to the midpoint year, 2010, using the single-model and integrated-models strategies.
The single-model approach showed that distances were larger in the earliest years than in later years (Figure {@fig:novel_distance_validation}B).
The integrated model approach did not display the same pattern (Figure {@fig:novel_distance_validation}C).
This suggests that training on smaller corpora leads to high variation and that an integrated model strategy is needed [@doi:10.1162/tacl_a_00008].
Therefore, we used the integrated-model strategy for the remainder of this work.

We next sought to identify tokens that changed during the 2000-2021 interval for the text from PubMed Central's Open Access Corpus (PMCOA) and the 2015-2022 interval for our preprint corpus.
We applied the CUSUM algorithm with integrated-model distance to correct for systematic differences in the underlying corpora.
We found 41281 terms with a detected changepoint from PMCOA and 2266 terms from preprints (Figures {@fig:preprint_published_changepoints}A and {@fig:preprint_published_changepoints}B).
Most of our detected changepoints (38019 for PMCOA and 2260 for preprints) only had a single event.

We detected a changepoint in PMCOA for 'cas9' from 2012 to 2013 (Figure {@fig:preprint_published_changepoints}C).
Before the changepoint, its closest neighbors were related to genetic elements (e.g., 'cas'1-3).
After the changepoint, its closest neighbors became terms related to targeting, sgRNA, gRNA, and other genome editing strategies, such as 'talen' and 'zfns' (Table {@tbl:cas9_neighbor_table}).
We detected change points for 'SARS' from 2002 to 2003 and 2019 to 2020 (Figure {@fig:preprint_published_changepoints}D), consistent with the emergences of SARS-CoV [@doi:10.1046/j.1440-1843.2003.00517.x] and SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105924; @doi:10.1038/s41564-020-0695-z] as observed human pathogens.
Before each changepoint, the closest neighbors for 'SARS' were difficult to synthesize and summarize.
After changepoints, the neighbors for 'SARS' were consistent with the acronym for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Tables {@tbl:sars_neighbor_table_one} and {@tbl:sars_neighbor_table_two}).

We detected 200 tokens with at least one changepoint in each corpus.
Only 25 of the 200 terms were detected to have simultaneous changes between the preprint and PMCOA corpora.
We examined the overlap of detected change points between preprints and published articles.
Many of these 25 were related to the COVID-19 pandemic (Supplementary Table {@tbl:published_preprint_change_table}).
The complete set of detected change points is available for further analysis (see Data Availability and Software).

A. The trajectory visualization of the token 'pandemic' through time.
It starts at the first mention of the token and progresses through each subsequent year.
Every data point shows the top five neighbors for the respective token.
B. The usage frequency of the token 'pandemic' through time.
The x-axis shows the year, and the y-axis shows the frequency for each token.
C. A word cloud visualization for the top 25 neighbors for the token 'pandemic' each year.
This visualization highlights each neighbor from a particular year and allows for the comparison between two years.
Tokens in purple are shared within both years, while tokens in red or blue are unique to their respective year.

Our online application allows users to explore how token meanings change over time.
Users can input tokens as text strings, MeSH IDs, Entrez Gene IDs, or Taxonomy IDs.
For example, users might elect to explore the term 'pandemic', for which we detected a changepoint between 2019 and 2020.
The application also shows users the token's nearest neighbors through time (Figure {@fig:website_walkthrough}A).
When using 'pandemic' as an example, users can observe that 'epidemic' remains similar through time, but taxid:114727 (the H1N1 subtype of influenza) only entered the nearest neighbors with the swine flu pandemic in 2009 and MeSH:C000657245 (COVID-19) appeared in 2020.
Additionally, users can view a frequency chart displaying the token's usage each year (Figure {@fig:website_walkthrough}B), which can be displayed as a raw count or adjusted by the total size of the corpus.
Previously detected changepoints are indicated on this chart.
The final visualization shows the union of the nearest 25 neighbors from each year, ordered by the number of years it was present (Figure {@fig:website_walkthrough}C).
This visualization includes a comparison function.
All functionalities are supported across PMCOA and preprint corpora, and users can toggle between them.
